\title{MDLC evaluation measure}
\usage{
MDLC()
}
\value{
Returns a function that is used to generate an evaluation set measure using MDLC value for the selected features
}
\description{
Generates an evaluation function that applies the Minimum-Description_Length-Criterion (MDLC) \insertCite{Sheinvald1990}{FSinR} to generate an evaluation measure for a set of features (set measure). This function is called internally within the \code{\link{filterEvaluator}} function.

## The direct application of this function is an advanced use that consists of using this 
# function directly to evaluate a set of features
## Classification problem

# Generate the evaluation function with Binary Consistency
MDLC_evaluator <- MDLC()
# Evaluate the features (parameters: dataset, target variable and features)
MDLC_evaluator(iris, "Species", c("Sepal.Length","Sepal.Width"))
