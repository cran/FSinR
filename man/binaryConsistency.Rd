\title{Binary consistency measure}
\usage{
binaryConsistency()
}
\value{
Returns a function that is used to generate an evaluation set measure using the binary consistency value for the selected features.
}
\description{
Generates an evaluation function that calculates the binary consistency, also known as "Sufficiency test" from FOCUS \insertCite{AlmuallimDietterich1991}{FSinR} (set measure). This function is called internally within the \code{\link{filterEvaluator}} function.
}
\examples{
\donttest{ 

## The direct application of this function is an advanced use that consists of using this 
# function directly to evaluate a set of features
## Classification problem

data("Titanic")
titanic <- as.data.frame(Titanic)

# A discrete dataset is used (in this case we use only several discrete columns)
titanic_subset <- titanic[, c("Class", "Sex", "Age", "Survived")]

# Generate the evaluation function with Binary Consistency
bc_evaluator <- binaryConsistency()
# Evaluate the features (parameters: dataset, target variable and features)
bc_evaluator(titanic_subset, "Survived", c("Class", "Sex", "Age"))
}
